I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Molecular and Computational Biology** at the **University of Southern California** (USC), expecting to graduate in Spring 2026. My research combines deep training in complex R&D systems, quantitative data analysis, and workflow design. I am experienced in translating scientific and technical complexity into structured insights through automation, analytics, and cross-functional collaboration.

Currently, I work as a Graduate Researcher in the *Xenopus* Egg Extract Synthetic Systems lab under Prof. [Xianrui Cheng](https://xianruichenglab.weebly.com/). My work focuses on designing and implementing end-to-end imaging and data workflows, building AI-assisted pipelines for spatial protein localization, and developing cell-free transcription–translation systems.

Prior to USC, I earned my B.Sc. in Microbiology and Cell Science with a minor in Bioinformatics (Cum Laude) from the **University of Florida**.

I am primarily seeking Research and Development (R&D) opportunities.
