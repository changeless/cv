<div style="font-size: 0.88em;" markdown="1">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular and Computational Biology at the **University of Southern California** (USC), with an expected graduation in Spring 2026. My research explores how cell-like organization emerges from biochemical systems, using synthetic and cell-free approaches combined with quantitative imaging and data-driven analysis.

I am currently a Graduate Researcher in the *Xenopus* Egg Extract Synthetic Systems lab under the supervision of Prof. [Xianrui Cheng](https://xianruichenglab.weebly.com/). My work focuses on analyzing spatial protein localization and cytoskeletal dynamics in *Xenopus* egg extract systems, with particular interest in how microtubule-based structures self-organize in the absence of canonical organizers. I showed that during cell-like compartment formation, centrosome-independent microtubule asters with reversed polarity emerge as early organizing structures and recruit cytokinesis-related signaling components, linking cytoskeletal self-organization to division pathways.

In parallel, I am developing a scalable and robust *Xenopus* egg extract–based cell-free protein synthesis platform aimed at overcoming the trade-off in existing CFPS systems between complex protein folding and cost-effective production. This platform demonstrates strong performance in producing PTM-dependent structural proteins and multimeric motor proteins, providing a promising alternative for both basic research and therapeutic protein production. Across these projects, my strengths lie in high-resolution imaging, quantitative analysis, and automated data processing workflows that enable reproducible, system-level insights.

Prior to USC, I earned my B.Sc. in Microbiology and Cell Science with a minor in Bioinformatics (Cum Laude) from the **University of Florida**, where I trained across multiple laboratories spanning distinct biological questions and experimental approaches. In the labs of [Piyush Jain](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/piyush-jain/), [Charles Baer](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/cbaer/), and [Julie Maupin-Furlow](https://microcell.ufl.edu/research/maupin-lab/), I worked on CRISPR-based diagnostics, evolutionary genomics, and archaeal protein regulation, gaining experience in molecular engineering, whole-genome analysis, and biochemical characterization. I further expanded my technical scope through visiting research with Prof. [Wei Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bKZA82cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) at the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, focusing on RNA regulatory network analysis, and with Prof. [Lei Wang](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/wang) at **UCSF**, working on chemical biology approaches to probe protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions.
